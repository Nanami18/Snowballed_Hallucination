**NOTICE: If you downloaded this dataset before the 27th of May 2023 please re-download it, as the previously-uploaded flights dataset had an issue.**

The answers for each dataset are either always 'yes' or 'no':
* 'no' for the flights dataset (there is never a sequence of connecting flights)
* 'yes' for the prime dataset (all the numbers are prime)
* 'no' for the senator dataset (no senator satisfies both requirements- being from a specific state and having gone to a specific college)
